## Senior Design Project 2019-2020

Research shows that about 8% of children need speech therapy globally. There are many speech therapy apps intended for children in the market, but many of them are expensive, not intuitive for younger children, or too simplistic for therapists. This project aims to create a one-stop-shop application for speech therapy that is useful to children, therapists, researchers, and caregivers. The major purpose is to create an affordable application with a dynamic user-interface system that adjusts its content for individual users. The project will also encrypt user information and provide a system for protecting patient data.
